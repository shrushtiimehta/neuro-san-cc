UNFCCC Climate Document Ingestion for Neo4j Knowledge Graph.

This module ingests United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
documents into a Neo4j-backed knowledge graph using the Graphiti framework.

Extends BaseIngestionTool with Neo4j-specific driver configuration and
decision action classification (founding vs follow-up).

Key Features:
    - Parses UNFCCC COP, CMA, CMP, SBI, and SBSTA decision documents
    - Extracts structured information: decisions, resolutions, annexes, and paragraphs
    - Identifies and extracts cross-document references between decisions
    - Classifies decisions as founding, follow-up, or neutral
    - Supports incremental processing with checkpoint-based resume functionality

Note:
    Reference linking, annex linking, and conference linking features have been
    disabled to reduce episode count and improve processing performance. References
    are still extracted and stored in episode metadata for potential future use.
