UNFCCC Climate Document Ingestion for FalkorDB Knowledge Graph.

This module ingests United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
documents into a FalkorDB-backed knowledge graph using the Graphiti framework.

Key Features:
    - Parses UNFCCC COP, CMA, CMP, SBI, and SBSTA decision documents
    - Extracts structured information: decisions, resolutions, annexes, and paragraphs
    - Identifies and extracts cross-document references between decisions
    - Supports incremental processing with checkpoint-based resume functionality
    - Includes performance optimizations for large-scale graph operations

Document Structure:
    - Splits documents by decisions/resolutions as primary sections
    - Separates annexes into distinct episodes
    - Extracts numbered paragraphs for granular reference access
    - Preserves metadata: conference type, year, session, location, FCCC references

Reference Extraction:
    - Decision references (e.g., "decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 69")
    - Article references (e.g., "Article 6 of the Paris Agreement")
    - Annex references (e.g., "Annex I to decision 4/CMA.1")
    - Paragraph references with optional decision context

Note:
    Reference linking, annex linking, and conference linking features have been
    disabled to reduce episode count and improve processing performance. References
    are still extracted and stored in episode metadata for potential future use.
